1. What is a database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.
A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
Example: In a college, storing student records like name, roll number, and marks in an Excel sheet becomes difficult as data grows. Using a database like MySQL allows easy searching, updating, and managing of student records.
Need: We need a database to avoid data redundancy, ensure data consistency, and enable quick data retrieval.

2. Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file based storage system.
A file-based storage system stores data in individual files and folders without any centralized control.
Challenges:
Data redundancy
Data inconsistency
Difficulty in accessing related data
Lack of data security
No support for concurrent access

3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
DBMS (Database Management System) is software that manages databases and provides an interface to interact with data.
Need for DBMS:
To eliminate redundancy
To ensure data consistency
To provide data security and access control
To support multi-user environment and concurrency
To easily retrieve and manipulate data

4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS?
Data Redundancy: DBMS avoids duplicate data using normalization.
Data Inconsistency: Changes made in one place reflect across the database.
Data Isolation: DBMS allows relational data to be accessed together.
Security Issues: DBMS provides access control mechanisms.
Concurrency Access: Multiple users can access data simultaneously in DBMS.

5. List Out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain?
Based on Data Model:
Hierarchical DBMS
Network DBMS
Relational DBMS
Object-oriented DBMS
Based on Number of Users:
Single-user
Multi-user
Based on Location:
Centralized DBMS
Distributed DBMS

6. What is the significance of Data Modelling and explain the types of Data Modelling?
Significance:
Data modeling defines how data is connected, stored, and processed. It helps in database design and consistency.
Types:
Conceptual Model: High-level, focuses on what data is stored.
Logical Model: Defines structure like tables, columns.
Physical Model: Details how data is stored physically on the system.

7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages?
Three Schema Architecture:
External Schema: User view of data.
Conceptual Schema: Logical structure of data.
Internal Schema: Physical storage structure.
Advantages:
Data abstraction
Separation of user and physical data
Easier maintenance and modification
Better data security
